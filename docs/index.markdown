# CF Node.js Logging Support

This library provides a bundle of targeted logging services for node.js applications running on Cloud Foundry which serves two main purposes:
It provides means to emit *structured application log messages* and instrument parts of your application stack to *collect request metrics*.

To get started follow our [Getting Started](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/getting-started/) chapters to install the library and learn how to integrate it with supported server frameworks.

Head over to the [General Usage](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/general-usage) articles to find information about the main logging functions.

Advanced topics, e.g., dynamic logging level threshold, SAP Passport support get covered in the [Advanced Usage](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/advanced-usage) articles.

Since version *.*.* the configuration of the logging library is customizable. Head over to [Configuration](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/configuration/configuration) for further information.

For details on the concepts and log formats please look at the sibling project for [java logging support](https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support).
