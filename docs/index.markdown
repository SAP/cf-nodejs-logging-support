This is a collection of support libraries for node.js applications running on Cloud Foundry that serve two main purposes: 
It provides (a) means to emit structured application log messages and (b) instrument parts of your application stack to collect request metrics.

To get started follow our [Getting Started](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/getting-started/) section to install the library and learn how to integrate it with supported server frameworks.

Head over to the [General Usage](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/general-usage) articles to find information about the main logging functions. 

Advanced topics, e.g., dynamic logging level threshold, SAP Passport support get covered in [Advanced Usage](/cf-nodejs-logging-support/advanced-usage) articles.

For details on the concepts and log formats please look at the sibling project for [java logging support](https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support).
